## What are Web Components?

> Web Components are a suite of technologies allowing you to create reusable custom elements.
>
> — MDN <sup>[1]</sup>

Currently, **`customElements`, the Shadow DOM, and HTML templates** make up web components.

**`customElements`** is the registry you would use to define your web components as either standalone elements or extensions of existing elements. There are a few extra APIs attached to `customElements` other than `define()` that we won't go into right now. <sup>[2]</sup>

Then you have the **Shadow DOM**, this is your very own isolated DOM for your custom element. This is what allows things like scoped CSS to be possible. <sup>[3]</sup>

Lastly, we have **HTML templates**. These are a couple of elements and APIs that are used to make reusable templates. `<template>` is used to keep a copy of your HTML until you render your HTML content to the DOM <sup>[4]</sup>. In conjunction with that, the `<slot>` element, used as a placeholder for content, can be passed into your custom element. <sup>[5]</sup>

### What can they do?

Web Components have a variety of different abilities that provide a unique API for the developer to interact with. These abilities cover a lot of use cases for the web community. Here are some of the abilities provided by the Web Component API:

- **React to changes in attributes** that are declared in the `observedAttributes` property via `attributeChangedCallback`.
  - This allows you to create elements that are reactive and reusable in nature because they can adjust when their "props" change.
- **Dispatch events upward** either to their immediate parent element or all the way through the tree.
  - This is different from libraries like React where one is required to pass down a function allowing them to pass things back upward.
- **Encapsulate CSS styles** which will prevent the styles from becoming global and clashing with existing stylesheets that one is using.
- **Reuse your component code** in multiple places as HTML elements. This is possible because of the way that Web Components create new instances of themselves.
- **Slotting**, or allowing elements to be passed down and rendered inside a web component like `children` via default and named slots.

## Advantages and disadvantages of using Web Components:

Beyond just looking at what Web Components capabilities are, it's important to look at how well they're implemented and what features they're missing. This can range from small nitpicks to issues that are the focus of the community. On the flip side, there are also the features that definitively prove conducive to an expeditious development experience and more manageable code base. We'll start with these first:

### Advantages

- **Web Components can fit in anywhere**.
  - Due to their nature of extending HTML elements, Web Components can be placed anywhere that HTML is used.
  - This is applicable to most modern JavaScript frameworks and libraries. Even browser extensions can utilize Web Components.
- **They don't care how content is rendered**.
  - Web Components weren't built around the concept of a render function, therefore, a specific style of rendering can be created by expanding upon the base `HTMLElement` class. A couple great examples of this include:
    - Polymer — utilizes a `render()` method, which returns a template, on their `Polymer` class. The method is called when states or specified attributes change.
    - Haunted — utilizes function components based on React's Hooks style to create Web Components that rerender on dependency changes.
- **They support bi-directional data flow**.
  - Due to Web Components nature of having no input on how you manage state, bi-directional data flow is made possible.
  - This allows developers to write more reactive code that avoids constant event-handling duplication and manual state management handling
  - I built an example of this, [check out two-way](https://github.com/ChrisBrownie55/two-way).

### Disadvantages

- **The lack of state management** in Web Components leaves raw Web Components with only events and attributes
  - Event-based state management, _without a state-machine or state-chart_, can lead to many errors and hard to manage code.
- **SSR and SSG are currently limited** because Web Components were built on JavaScript APIs that don't map to regular HTML5 elements. <sup>[7]</sup>
  - Most options these days that do map to HTML elements are polyfills that are just more userland JavaScript.
- You will likely have to **abandon all of your bundling and tooling applications** that you're used to in favor of full Web Component frameworks such as:
  - Stencil.js
  - The Polymer Project
  - Or no framework at all
- **Progressive enhancement is much more difficult** for the same reasons that SSR and SSG are limited.
  - The inability to remove JavaScript from Web Components makes custom elements _extremely_ difficult to progressively enhance compared to other modern frameworks.

### How can we make it better?

Web Components are lacking many features that make web development itself more intuitive today, all in all Web Components have a long way to go. To improve upon the _"Custom Elements v1"_ standard, I think it's important to look at the successes and failures of past libraries and frameworks.

#### First let's look at jQuery

jQuery is a library for DOM manipulation, event-handling, animation, and Ajax. <sup>[8]</sup> The library itself is quite large at **87.6 KB minified** _(30.4 KB gzipped)_, this is a stark difference from Web Components which are completely free in terms of size and performance (if you don't use polyfills). <sup>[9]</sup>

jQuery is entirely state-framework independent thus relying solely on events for it's state. This being said, events being the source of truth for state is messy and doesn't scale efficiently.

##### How does this compare to Web Components?

In comparison, Web Components are also event-based, but they also contain attributes. Attributes make things better... almost. They provide a convenient way to store state as properties passed to an element, however, this doesn't fix solely event-based development though.

##### A modal in jQuery:

In the below contrived example, we've created a button that a data-attribute that points the modal we wish to open. With that, we have a modal with a matching ID. Inside the modal we have a button that points back to the modal so that we can close it as well.

Keep in mind that, this example is very simplistic and doesn't necessarily show the pitfalls of this approach.

```html
<!-- Opens the modal -->
<button data-open-modal="settings-modal">Open Modal</button>

<!-- The Modal -->
<div id="settings-modal" hidden>
	<h1>Settings</h1>
	<!--  Closes the modal  -->
	<button data-close-modal="settings-modal">Exit</button>
</div>
```

Now for the jQuery magic that makes these modals function.

To start off, we have to get the buttons that have `data-open-modal` attributes. This is good enough for a static site that contains modals but this would very quickly become more complicated if you needed to dynamically keep track of elements with this attribute.

Now that we have the buttons, we can attach click event listeners to them. Once the button is clicked, we need to get the value of `data-open-modal` via the `dataset` property and use it as an ID.

Lastly, show the modal. For the buttons that hide the modal, the only differences are the data-attribute names and that we will be calling `.hide()` instead of `.show()`.

```js
// Get all of the elements that open modals when clicked
const openButtons = $('[data-open-modal]').toArray()
openButtons.forEach((el) => {
	// When the button is clicked, show the modal
	$(el).on('click', () => {
		// Get the modal attached to the button
		const modal = $(`#${el.dataset.openModal}`)
		modal.show()
	})
})

const closeButtons = $('[data-close-modal]').toArray()
closeButtons.forEach((el) => {
	// Everything is the same, but now we're going to hide the modal
	$(el).on('click', () => {
		const modal = $(`#${el.dataset.closeModal}`)
		modal.hide()
	})
})
```

This method of dealing with application development is very inefficient and can cost quite a few work hours more to maintain. "Why?" you might ask, because jQuery doesn't come with built-in reactivity. It's a library of functions, many of which map to simple DOM methods.

#### How does this compare to more modern frameworks and libraries:

##### React

For this example, we're going to stick with this super simple idea of simply showing and hiding the modal and avoid focusing on more complex features that a real modal would need.

##### Vue
