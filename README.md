# The Brownie Blog

This is the GitHub repository for my blog at https://andria.page/

Here I write articles about my thoughts on and experiences with code. I try to write as often as possible but time constraints can make producing new articles difficult.

If you have any ideas or concerns please open an issue or pull request. All contributions are welcome:

- Articles
- Bugs and fixes
- Accessibility fixes/concerns
- Translations

This site was built using [Next.js](https://www.nextjs.org/) with [React](https://reactjs.org/).
