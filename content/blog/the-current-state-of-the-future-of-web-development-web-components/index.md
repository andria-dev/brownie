## What are Web Components?

> Web Components are a suite of technologies allowing you to create reusable custom elements.
>
> — MDN <sup>[1]</sup>

Currently, **`customElements`, the shadow DOM, and HTML templates** make up web components.

`customElements` is the registry you would use to define your web components as either standalone elements or extensions of existing elements. There are a few extra APIs attached to `customElements` other than `define()` that we won't go into right now. <sup>[2]</sup>

Then you have the shadow DOM, this is your very own isolated DOM for your custom element. This is what allows things like scoped CSS to be possible. <sup>[3]</sup>

Lastly, we have HTML templates. These are a couple of elements and APIs that are used to make reusable templates. `<template>` is used to keep a copy of your HTML until you render your HTML content to the DOM <sup>[4]</sup>. In conjunction with that, the `<slot>` element, used as a placeholder for content, can be passed into your custom element. <sup>[5]</sup>

### What can they do?

Web Components have a variety of different abilities that provide a unique API for the developer to interact with. These abilities cover a lot of use cases for the web community. Here are some of the abilities provided by the Web Component API:

- React to changes in attributes, that are declared in the `observedAttributes` property, via `attributeChangedCallback`.
  - This allows you to create elements that are reactive and reusable in nature because they can adjust when their "props" change.
- Dispatch events upward either to their immediate parent element or all the way through the tree.
  - This is different from libraries like React where one is required to pass down a function allowing them to pass things back upward.
- Encapsulate CSS styles which will prevent the styles from becoming global and clashing with existing stylesheets that one is using.
- Reuse your code in multiple places as HTML elements. This is possible because of the way that Web Components create new instances of themselves.
- Slotting, or allowing elements to be passed down and rendered inside a web component like `children` via default and named slots.

## Advantages and disadvantages of using Web Components:

Beyond just looking at what Web Components capabilities are, it's important to look at how well they're implemented and what features they're missing. This can range from small nitpicks to issues that are the main focus of the community. On the flip side, there are also the features that definitively prove conducive to an expeditious development experience and more manageable code base. We'll start with these ones first:

### Advantages

- Web Components can fit in anywhere.
  - Due to their nature of extending HTML elements, Web Components can be placed anywhere that HTML is used.
  - This is applicable to most modern JavaScript frameworks and libraries. Even browser extensions can utilize Web Components.
- They don't care how content is rendered.
  - Web Components weren't built around the concept of a render function, therefore, a specific style of rendering can be created by expanding upon the base HTMLElement class. A couple great examples of this include:
    - Polymer — utilizes a `render()` method, which returns a template, on their `Polymer` class. The method is called when states or specified attributes change.
    - Haunted — utilizes function components based on React's Hooks style to create Web Components that rerender on dependency changes.
- They support bi-directional data flow.

  - Web Components <due to nature can do bi-directional data flow>.
  - I built an example of this, check it out: <link>

### Disadvantages

TODO: Finish these bullets
- <event and attribute based stats>
- <SSR and SSG>
- <bundling and tools>
- <doesn't support progressive enhancement>

### How can we make it better?

<Web components are lacking>, <there's a lot to improve>. <It's important to look at successes and failures of the past> with libraries like <jquery, angular, react, vue...>.

#### First let's look at JQuery

<JQuery is huge>. <JQuery is entirely state-framework independent and therefore relies on events>. <Event-only based development is messy>, <doesn't scale well>.

##### How does this compare to Web Components?

<Web Components have attributes>. <Attributes make things better... almost>, <they provide a way to store state as properties passed to an element>. <They don't fix solely event-based development though>.

##### A modal in JQuery:

<Explain the HTML>.

```html
```

<Explain the JS>.

```js
```

<Make conclusion>.

#### How does this compare to more modern frameworks and libraries:

##### React

##### Vue
